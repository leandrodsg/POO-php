# Repository: POO-php

This repository contains exercises and projects developed to practice the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP. The content is organized in a modular way, reflecting the folder structure used in the local development environment with XAMPP.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into two main categories:

- **CodeExamples:**  
  Practical examples and short activities focused on specific PHP and OOP concepts.

- **Projetos (Projects):**  
  Small complete applications that integrate the concepts learned throughout the exercises, including operations with a MySQL database.

Each folder within these categories has its own `README` file with explanations in both Portuguese and English. These files detail the purpose, features, and usage instructions for each exercise or project.

## Individual Documentation

Refer to the `README.md` files inside each subfolder to get detailed information about each example or project. They follow a common structure with sections such as:

- Exercise or project description
- Folder and file structure
- Steps for execution
- Additional notes on features

## Purpose

This repository focuses on hands-on PHP learning with emphasis on OOP, covering topics such as:

- Classes and objects
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Database integration
- Form handling and validation
